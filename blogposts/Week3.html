            It is very exciting to learn CSS and to see how goes in hand with
            HTML to create and design a visually aesthetic website. The lectures
            helped me engage with the content in a way that allow me to code
            alongside to effectively understand the work without losing track of
            what is happening. The lecture showed me how there are different
            methods in how to code with CSS and HTML, which helps in
            understanding different aspects of the code that I use instead of
            just using and copying one method all the time as there may be a
            more effective method to use. The lectures were interesting in how
            they showed how I must be able to design a website take can be used
            on multiple different types of platforms. This made me reconsider my
            ideas for the website to be viewable a phone and computers.

            In the reading, Mailloux explores the relationship between language
            conventions and the context in the interpretation of language.
            Alongside with the lecture it highlights how to decide which UI and
            UX to use, we must first gather how successful it is then it can
            become a convention. <br /> <br> Mailloux defines convention as suitable
            practices commonly used in a context. (Mailloux 1983: 399).
            Indicating how conventions in UI and UX must be agreed upon and used
            as a base for it to be a convention. When understanding UI and UX
            conventions as a creator we must look at how the user will react to
            it and how they feel about it. Thus, the interaction between the
            user and UI/UX is what is important as that feedback and response is
            the convention. As if the user can interact with it successfully
            then it has become the convention but if not, I must go back to the
            wireframe and find a new UI/UX that can successfully for full it to
            become the convention. An example is the previous and next buttons,
            these buttons are at the end of the page, allowing the user to go
            straight to the next one. It would be ineffective to put them at the
            top as then the user has to scroll up again to go to the next page.
            <br /> <br>
            It shows how UI and UX conventions have become limiting to new
            ideas. This is because the user becomes used to UI and UX
            conventions as it may not allow them to experience a new way of how
            it can be done. Since it is a convention the user will always want
            something similar to that and may leave your website if it does not
            meet that convention.
