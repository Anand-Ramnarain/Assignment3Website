            Since I was not happy with my assignment 1 website, I decided to
            restart my website. This week start by looking into other websites
            and looking at ideas that will help inspire me to for my website to
            create a better one. As I was going through the portfolio website I
            notice I common aspect on the home page. This is that the home page
            work separately from the other as each section on the website is
            given on the homepage like a “what each section is about”. Then I
            decide to redesign my homepage similar to those types of portfolio
            websites whereby the homepage will give the user a small and brief
            summary of what is on each page. Another thing I had to consider was
            my navbar from the home page. As this I rather made it so when the
            user clicks on it, it takes them to the section on the home page
            rather than the page it relates to. This is so that the user can
            rather be able to see the type of content they are going to find and
            from that section on the homepage they can then go to that page.

            Making A Feminist Internet In Africa: Why The Internet Needs African
            Feminists And Feminisms
          </h4>

          <p class="essayText">
            The article "Making A Feminist Internet In Africa: Why The Internet
            Needs African Feminists And Feminisms" by Sheena Magenya, focuses on
            the Gendered Digital Divide, the culture in Africa, and how a
            feminist will approach the Internet and how it promotes social
            justice and gender equality. The close reading is concentrated on
            how technology and the internet function in our society and how
            gender interacts with it. It shows how there is gender-based
            violence and discrimination and how it is prevalent on African
            websites today and that a feminist strategy is required to solve
            these problems and guarantee that the internet is accessible and
            usable to all. <br /><br />
            The Imagine a Feminist Internet Meeting was followed by a few
            developments. There weren't enough female voices online, despite the
            increase. This is seen in the gender-based violence on the internet.
            (Magenya, 2020) African feminists working towards combating this
            violence by using strong legal frameworks, digital literacy
            programs, and community support systems. It aims to create safer
            online spaces that allow freedom of expression and protect women's
            rights to participate without fear of intimidation or violence.
            <br /><br />
            African Feminists will not only help inform others, but by sharing
            their life stories they can form communities which would help people
            with similar experiences. This will create a more meaningful
            experience for users online and reverse cycles of oppression
            (Magenya, 2020). As it is building solidarities. Through stories and
            feminist movements, there are various perspectives, experiences, and
            struggles. The internet is the tool used in connecting feminist
            activists across the continent. This allows African feminists to
            leverage digital networks to build communities which can exchange
            knowledge, and talk to form a collective to act, ultimately
            strengthening the feminist movement and its impact.
