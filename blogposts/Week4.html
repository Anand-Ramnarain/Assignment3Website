            Continuing with my website I have seen how important it is to create
            wireframes. Otherwise, I'd have to build my website just out of my
            head and this does not work out as there are multiple ways in which
            the site can look and it is hard to choose which way to do it. I
            started off drawing my wireframes on paper to try and get an idea in
            mind of how I wanted my website to look, then I remade it on my
            computer which allowed me to rethink some of my ideas and clean up
            the layout so that it is not too complicated. Alongside, my
            wireframe I have been thinking of different ways to display items,
            like a secondary nav bar which will be able to scroll or give a
            drop-down option. I have gone through the video for displaying items
            to give me a way to code them.

            The readings and the lectures have helped me further my wireframes.
            As my wireframes were messy and very vague in the sense that I even
            got confused about what I wanted to put in a certain place. The
            readings have helped me recognize I need to only use key information
            as too much will overwhelm and confuse the users and too little will
            make it so they don’t know what is happening. <br /><br />This
            week's lecture has helped me identify that I need systems that will
            allow the user to go to the top of the page automatically. I had
            never thought about how tedious it would be to scroll from the end
            of a long page back to the top. Another fact I had to consider was
            the Navigation bar. As you can overload this nav bar with too many
            options or pages but rather have fewer which can take the user to a
            different page with more options as it would overwhelm the user with
            a lot of options to choose from.

            Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology

          <p class="essayText">
            Gibson’s article "Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology."
            explores different ways in which interfaces can be designed and
            experienced, beyond the traditional graphical user interface (GUI)
            that was prevalent at the time. <br /><br />Gibson’s argues that GUI
            Gibson argues that GUI is limited in its ability to fully engage.
            with users and create immersive experiences This is agreeable to an
            extent as GUI on certain site are dull and ineffective but others
            can take you on a journey, looking at mythic games website is simple
            but through the use of GUI and effect it takes the user on a journey
            through the website as it they are experiencing it. <br /><br />
            Gibson’s article made me think about the different approaches to
            interface technology, and how to use the interface to create forms
            of engagement, interaction, and communication. It made me think of
            using the UI, UX and graphics to immerse the user into the website
            so that they can find a better understanding of themselves.
