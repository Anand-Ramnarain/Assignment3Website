            During this week, I was focusing on the small aspect of my website
            as well as all the bugs that I came access while going through the
            website. This includes a scrolling bar by my nav bar and for my main
            page. As it allowed both sections to scroll down which then allowed
            my nav bar section to be blank. The aspect in which I focused on was
            the movement between certain pages. As some of the pages allow for a
            smooth transition to the other. These small aspects allowed me to
            get closer to my goal alignment.

            I am still working on certain aspects of the website as the
            transitions. As I noticed my interaction on my website is far weaker
            compared to others. I explored different options on how to implement
            and effectively achieve this, thus allowing me to achieve my goal
            for the website. <br /><br />
            Goal Alignment- My goal for my website is to give my users an
            experience that has easy navigation with effect interface so that
            the user can seamlessly move through the website to where they want
            to go to. <br /><br />
            Information Structure- I want to make the information structure
            clear and simple by spreading my information across multiple pages
            thus the user can select the page they see the necessary
            information. <br /><br />

          <h4 class="bSubhead">User Experience - A Research Agenda</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            In their article, Hassenzahl and Tractinsky provide an overview of
            the concept of user experience and propose a way to advance it. They
            argue that the user experience is multidimensional. This indicates
            that each aspect such as emotions, controls, behaviour, and context
            plays a role in how the user interacts with the website. They also
            emphasize the importance of UX, to rather show it as interactive
            products, services, and environments for the user. <br /><br />
            One key point that stood out to me is the subjectivity and dynamic
            nature of UX. They point out that UX is not just a matter of
            usability or functionality. Meaning that on my website the user
            experience relates to the userâ€™s perception and goals they wish to
            complete on my website. <br /><br />Overall, I found the reading to
            be insightful in the exploration of the concept of UX and its
            importance in design to the user. Its emphasis on the dynamic and
            subjective nature of UX made me consider the importance of
            considering users' perspectives and experiences in designing the
            systems of the website.
