          <p class="essayText">
            The Lack of Scalability in my website was not working as how I
            thought it was, when I made the screen smaller with the development
            tools, the icon would appear and my header would go away but when
            they clicked on it the nav bar tools didn’t appear in the section
            that would come up and this did because I struggle as I could not
            figure out why this was happening
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="bSubhead">Where Did I Struggle?</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            The aspect of the website with which I struggled was: <br /><br />
            Layout Breaks: When scaling sections, one common issue that occurred
            was the layout break and become distorted on certain screen sizes.
            This can happen because my CSS properties and rules are not properly
            defined. It is a struggle in finding appropriate CSS techniques such
            as media queries to ensure the sections scale smoothly. <br /><br />
            Content Overflow: Another challenge was handling content overflow
            when scaling sections. If the content within certain sections
            exceeds the available space, it can cause scrolling issues,
            overlapping elements, or content getting cut off. I need to consider
            how the content within the sections will adjust or reflow to fit
            within the scaled dimensions

            Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable
            augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information
          </h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            Information geographies refer to the spatial dimensions of
            information flows and their impact on societies. cultures. and
            economies. (Graham & Sabbata & Zook 2015).meaning that information
            geographies are concerned with the way information moves and is
            distributed across different spaces or parts of the world and how
            this movement affects societies. <br /><br />
            The concept of "(im)mutable augmentations" (Graham & Sabbata & Zook
            2015). suggests that the digital realm can store and disseminate
            vast amounts of information, which can have empowering and
            constraining effects. On one hand, it can be argued that individual
            capabilities by providing access to knowledge and resources. But it
            can also amplify existing inequalities and power imbalances.
            <br /><br />
            In the article, they talk about the “mapping geographies of access”
            (Graham & Sabbata & Zook 2015: 102).which is about about the uneven
            geographies of geographic information as this highlights that
            geographic information is not evenly distributed or accessible.
            Showing that there are disparities in the availability, production,
            and usage of geographic information across different regions and
            user groups. <br /><br />
            In summary, it emphasizes the uneven distribution of geographic
            information and the importance of studying both the front-end
            platforms and back-end databases, as it calls for a critical
            examination of power dynamics and visibility within information
            geographies to strive for a more inclusive and equitable landscape.

            Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine Results
          </h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            The concept of "digital hegemonies" (Ballatore & Graham &Sen 2017)
            implies that there is control applied on certain platforms in the
            digital realm. In the context of digital media, it refers to the
            power and influence wielded by search engines, such as Google, in
            shaping the information that users encounter when conducting
            searches. <br /><br />
            The phrase "the localness of search engine results" (Ballatore &
            Graham &Sen 2017). and the ways explained in the article indicate
            that search engine algorithms consider various factors related to a
            user's geographical location in the search results. As search
            engines aim to provide personalized and relevant information to
            users, and they achieve this by using the user's location and giving
            them results to this. This means of using the user’s location
            results in information access that can change perspectives depending
            on what they are exposed to.

            How this relates to and impact web development in SA?
          </h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            Awareness of Information Disparities and Internet Connectivity: In
            the reading on information geographies highlights that there is an
            even distribution of information globally. In South Africa, there
            are significant disparities in access to technology and internet
            connectivity, as I experience many times that internet connectivity
            does not work and I must wait till it comes back online, this
            affects everyone but in terms of web developers, this creates a
            digital divide as they must work harder towards creating inclusive
            web experiences that the users can access in different regions and
            with different internet capabilities. <br /><br />
            It is part of our duty as web developers in the Global South to
            boost representation and engagement in the digital material we are
            involved in producing. This can entail enticing South Africans to
            join in online debates and creating websites that are as
            platform-compatible as feasible. Bridging the information gap
            between the global North and South will assist ensure a more
            equitable distribution of knowledge.
