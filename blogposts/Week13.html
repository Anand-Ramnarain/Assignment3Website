            For this week I am trying to add all my weekly blogs and texts to my
            website. As I want to try and find different ways in which to put my
            text in my documents without having to use multiple HTML pages. As
            in my last assignment, I create an HTML page for each blog week and
            it just seemed messy and overcomplicated with pages that I didn’t
            even need that is why my focus was to try and reduce the amount of
            HTML pages for this website. <br /><br />
            Also this week, I would love to try new and different colour
            palettes for my website, as my colour palette didn't work. The
            original one that I planned to use was good in theory but
            ineffective. I did a lot of research into the colour theory to see
            which colour palette best suited my site, while still representing
            me. However, my website looked unprofessional. The colours worked,
            according to colour theory, but I don't think I utilised the colour
            palette correctly.

          <h4 class="bSubhead">Digital Divide Widens</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            The article highlights the significant impact of the Covid-19
            pandemic on education and the widening digital divide. It emphasizes
            that over “1.5 billion students” (Glynos & Tataki, 2020). globally
            have been affected by school closures, leading to a shift towards
            e-learning. However, a considerable number of students lack access
            to computers and do not have any form of internet access at home.
            The digital divide is challenging educators in ensuring continuous
            learning even with the existing inequalities. This is particularly
            evident in low-income countries, where a large majority of students
            are unable to go online. It gives short-term solutions like lending
            laptops or providing free SIM cards and data usage to learn but they
            are not sufficient to bridge the gap. To prevent increasing
            inequalities and the digital divide from going further users or
            students must be provided with high-quality and affordable internet
            access to all.

            Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial
            Gender Classification
          </h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            The article highlights the issue of bias in machine learning
            algorithms, specifically in the context of facial analysis
            algorithms. As in the article, they evaluated to assess bias in
            automated facial analysis algorithms and found significant
            inequalities in the distribution of gender and skin types. In the
            article, it emphasizes the need for attention and action to address
            the inequalities in the accuracy of gender classification systems.
            They argue that if commercial companies want to develop facial
            analysis algorithms that are genuinely fair, transparent, and
            accountable, they must address these inequalities and biases and
            present them in their algorithms. As of now, their algorithms are
            unable to accurately identify darker-skinned people, more
            specifically darker-skinned women. An example of why this is a
            problem is that some companies make use of AI in job application
            screens. If an AI is unable to “classify” a person or they do not
            fit the standards in terms of race or gender, they are rejected.
            <br /><br />
            Overall, the importance of understanding and addressing bias in
            machine learning algorithms, especially in facial analysis systems,
            is to ensure e unbiased outcomes for all individuals, regardless of
            their race or gender.
