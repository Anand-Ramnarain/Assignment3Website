            This week I started coding my new designs for each page, mainly the
            home page as a starting point. My main goal for this week is in
            completing the home page of the new website as I know what was going
            to be on there. As in the first website, I did know what I want on
            there. I designed started my design by using each header that was
            going to be in my navbar as each section for the homepage. I first
            simply did everything just using HTML and CSS, this was mainly for
            me to avoid complications with JavaScript. In my coding, I saw that
            by giving just a summary on each section I was able to reuse code
            from other sections, this help me in a time sense as I did not have
            to go and copy and paste the code and change the names but rather
            use the name as the CSS styling property, this also allowed to not
            have too much clutter in the sense that my code in CSS would not be
            the same.

            From now the aspect I would like to change to incorporate JavaScript

            number of divs so that my code doesn’t seem too long on my

            system was not working. Now I would love to try and figure that out
            so that I can use JS for my main navbar.

          <h4 class="bSubhead">Towards Decolonising Computational Sciences</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            When we talk about the decolonizing of computational sciences this
            is referred to as taking necessary steps towards creating a more
            inclusive and acceptable field that highlights the diversifying of
            perspectives, systems, and methodologies. (Birhane & Guest 2020) In
            the article there are two focuses the first is the “realization of
            the present-day system's behaviour towards women of colour” (Birhane
            & Guest 2020: 1) This refers to the understanding that the current
            system, has inherited and continues to be a hostile and oppressive
            environment, that foster behaviours and principles specifically
            targeted at women of colour. Indicating that women face challenges
            and discrimination due to the intersection of their gender and race.
            The other focus is on “the rejection of centring people as a
            solution” (Birhane & Guest 2020: 1) This implies that focusing
            solely on one person's experiences is not enough to address the
            problems faced by women of colour. Instead, it suggests that there
            are larger issues that need greater solutions. It needs to address
            the discrimination and inequality against people and women of
            colour. In the article the concept of “decolonization in the context
            of computational sciences” (Birhane & Guest 2020) and needing to
            address the obstacles that prevent Black women and other
            marginalized groups from participating in fields. It emphasizes that
            decolonizing the system requires individuals to decolonize
            themselves. highlighting the importance of investigating and
            dismantling the historical and current racist and oppressive roots
            formed in computational sciences. As this process will be gradual
            but necessary for the progression of the field. Showing this will
            not only will it benefit Black women, but it will also contribute to
            the overall advancement of computer science.
