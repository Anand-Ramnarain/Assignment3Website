            When starting to learn about HTML I was excited as I love coding and
            learning how to use different languages as it is my first-time
            coding with HTML. With any new language is it kind of easy to start
            to learn as almost all coding languages are very similar therefore
            it was simple enough to get the hang of it quickly as I start
            learning coding from Delphi in high school which is a harder
            language to learn first? Just the only part that usually changes and
            which I need to get used to is the syntax of the language as I
            usually always end up confusing different languages or putting a
            semicolon where it should be and end up with an error. with HTML I
            see it is rather used to describe the structure and content of a web
            page to create.<br /><br />
            Overall starting html was exciting and fun to see all the different
            kinds of things I could create for a webpage to develop a website. I
            just need to keep practicing remembering the syntax that goes with
            HTML to avoid looking for small errors which can go away with a
            comma or semi-colon.

          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            The history of the internet is fascinating and complex, there are a
            series of milestones and developments that have transformed the way
            we live, work, and communicate. The internet was first developed in
            the 1960s as a means of connecting computers and sharing information
            between nodes, for only certain industries but change it develop to
            allow use by other industries. Then in the early 1990s, the world
            wide web was developed allowing for the creation of easily
            accessible web pages and opening the Internet to a wider audience.
            Just understanding and viewing the history of the internet shows how
            it has had a profound impact on our lives we communicate and connect
            with others to work and access all kinds of information. I find the
            history of the internet interesting to see how the internet has
            changed over the years and how it continues to shape our world, I
            look forward to how it will further evolve and impact my life and
            others.

          <h4 class="bSubhead">Why you should choose HTML5</h4>

          <p class="essayText">
            Through Bruce Lawson's article on "Why you should choose HTML5" from
            when I started using HTML you can understand how supports why you
            should use HTML. This is because its users use other languages like
            CSS and JavaScript to provide information and perform extra coding
            functions to effectively construct a webpage. Through his article, I
            can see how HTML can be used for dynamic and adaptable change in a
            website like using Sections to organize the coding page and separate
            paragraphs and code which is helpful to understand you have place
            code. It shows me how HTML is effective to organise a coders page to
            keep everything in order.
