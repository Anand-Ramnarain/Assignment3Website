            This was my first-time using GitHub and setting it up. I didn’t
            understand how it works but after going through the tutorial and
            YouTube videos, I think I understand how to use GitHub to save my
            progress and have it there if anything were to go wrong, as it is
            also a way to share and view code with multiple people. It seems
            like more of an effective way to send in code for an assignment than
            the files which sometimes don’t even open.

            My goal for this course is to be able to further understand
            different coding languages and the elements used towards designing a
            website so that I feel confident to design my website.

          <h4 class="bSubhead">As We May Think - Bush</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            Bush’s reading was eye-opening in the way in which he looks at it
            from a futuristic perspective. He outlines a vision for the future
            of science, technology, and information management. He made accurate
            predictions of how technology is going to advance, and because of
            this, his ideas laid the base for many technologies created today,
            like hypertext, the internet, and the World Wide Web. For example,
            the hyperlink, which allows users to jump from one document or
            webpage to another, was based on Bush’s theory. Along with his
            prediction, he also suggests information is becoming like “growing
            mountains” as there is so much information that it overwhelms him.
            This part I related to as with the advancement from his work
            information has even grown larger as you can get from anywhere in
            the world now, but I understand that through all the information if
            we must be able to choose how and which one to interact with. Bush’s
            ideas are still used today and almost everyone directly or
            indirectly, through how he explains rapid selection, to add one
            sheet to an operator and within seconds others can add in their
            notes, and it can be suggestive to others. When reading this I just
            looked at my computer screen and saw I was doing that as I had other
            tabs open which I can view to gain a better perspective on the
            reading to further understand and get my conclusions. Bush’s reading
            just creates an awareness of how the possibilities of the past
            became the present and can still be developed in the future to
            become even more effective. Overall, "As We May Think" continues to
            shape our understanding of the possibilities of technology and its
            potential to transform the way we live and work as it has a profound
            influence on the development of technology and people.
