            This week I tried implementing JavaScript within my blog section to
            reduce the number of divs on the HTML page. For this, I created a
            for like which creates a divs and assignment each element to the
            section I want it to be in. This was what I wanted to achieve as it
            reduced the divs for my blog.html I used this code as there was a
            large amount of them but in the index.html I rather kept them
            without the JS as I felt this was making more work and the other
            JavaScript were somehow conflicting and then it would not work.

          <h4 class="bSubhead">How my CSS relates to the HTML and JS</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            My main form of relating CSS to HTML and JS is through classes, as I
            assign classes to use the CSS style and in my JS I created for loops
            to create elements and assign their classes. CSS purely styles the
            elements to control their appearance and I am trying to use JS to
            manipulate and modify my CSS dynamically.

            Benefits: <br />
            Improved User Experience: This is about creating a responsive design
            that ensures that your website looks and functions well on all
            devices, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience. It
            adapts the layout, content, and features to fit the screen size,
            making it easier for users to navigate and interact with the site.
            <br /><br />
            But with these come some challenges like <br />
            Content Prioritization: With limited screen space on smaller
            devices, prioritizing content becomes vital. I have to carefully
            plan and design the layout to make sure that the most important
            information is visible and accessible. <br />
            Design Constraints: Responsive design compromises in the design
            process to be used on different screen sizes. I must balance my
            aesthetics and be mindful of the usability across devices, I must
            consider the font sizes, image scaling and other aspects to ensure a
            pleasant user experience.

            When thinking about how my code matters in digital colonialism, I
            can identify these things in my coding practice that I am aware of?
          </h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            There main aspect which I can see in terms of my coding practices is
            in creating a more inclusive Design. Meaning that I must use
            inclusive design principles by considering the needs and
            perspectives of diverse users. This involves making the code and
            website accessible, language-friendly, and cultural sensitivity in
            software development.
