          <p class="essayText">
            APIs known as Application Programming Interfaces, are sets of rules
            and protocols that allow different software applications to
            communicate with each other. They are used to define the methods and
            data that developers can use to interact with a particular software
            component.

          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            There are numerous problems faced by marginalized groups as
            emphasized in Costanza Chock's reading on travelling while trans.
            The reading emphasizes these problems face and the issues concerning
            the design justice system as well as ways to address these issues.
            Gaps in design can be filled through cooperation, according to the
            Design Justice Network (Costanza-Chock 2020: 6). <br /><br />
            A one-time conversation won't be able to address all the problems
            that marginalized people confront, thus this partnership should
            continue. To change systems, this cooperation is essential
            (Costanza-Chock 2020: 6). As in terms of the reading and the tech
            industry, this cooperation can play a role in developing solutions
            and platforms that provide resources and support for transgender
            travellers or people in the LGBT community. This can involve
            creating travel-related applications, websites, or online
            communities that offer information on transgender-friendly
            destinations, local LGBTQ+ resources, and safety tips for trans
            individuals while travelling. <br /><br />
            Designers don't always intend to disadvantage or discriminate
            against people when they build items. However, this is still what
            their designs do. (Costanza-Chock 2020: 5) This can lead to
            exclusive environments, but rather with cooperation and trying to be
            more open to creating inclusive and diverse environments where
            everyone, regardless of their gender identity or background, feels
            welcome and supported.
