          <span class="highlight">Hello</span> There.<br /><br />My name is
          <span class="highlight">Anand Ramnarain</span>, the creator of this
          website you are on now.<br /><br />I am a student at the University of
          The Witwatersrand. I am a dedicated and hard-working individual. I am
          passionate about code development, and learning new languages, no
          matter what anyone says I will stay persistent on a problem till I can
          find a solution.<br /><br />I am currently doing a course in Game
          Design, majoring in Interactive Media and Game design. This has
          allowed me to view coding and user interface in different lights, as a
          developer and designer you must always consider the cause and effect
          to the user.<br /><br />I created 2 websites using HTML, CSS and
          JavaScript to demonstrate the techniques and knowledge I have gained
          at the university to develop and create a website that can effectively
          comminate and display the necessary information, for you to understand
          and view my progress within the Interactive Media course in my degree.
          <br /><br /> <span>What I Want To Achieve</span> <br /><br />
          I want to achieve an effective and communicative User Experience. The
          user experience is how a user interacts with the website. I would like
          to make my website easy for users to find what they're looking for and
          to navigate through my website seamlessly. I will achieve this by
          having a clear and organized layout, fast loading times, and mobile
          optimization, so it will be useable on different types of platforms.
          Another aspect I will achieve in a great website is my content. My
          websiteâ€™s content will be relevant, and engaging content that provides
          value to the user. I like also to focus on the design. The design of
          my website will be visually appealing and consistent with my brand.
          This will be done through my colour scheme of colour which I like and
          which I feel represent me, and imagery that reflects on me while still
          appealing to your user
