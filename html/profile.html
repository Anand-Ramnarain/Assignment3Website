          <span class="highlight">Hello</span> There.<br /><br />My name is
          <span class="highlight">Anand Ramnarain</span>, the creator of this
          website you are on now.<br /><br />I am a student at the University of
          The Witwatersrand. I am a dedicated and hard-working individual. I am
          passionate about code development, and learning new languages, no
          matter what anyone says I will stay persistent on a problem till I can
          find a solution.<br /><br />I am currently doing a course in Game
          Design, majoring in Interactive Media and Game design. This has
          allowed me to view coding and user interface in different lights, as a
          developer and designer you must always consider the cause and effect
          to the user.<br /><br />I created 2 websites using HTML, CSS and
          JavaScript to demonstrate the techniques and knowledge I have gained
          at the university to develop and create a website that can effectively
          comminate and display the necessary information, for you to understand
          and view my progress within the Interactive Media course in my degree.
