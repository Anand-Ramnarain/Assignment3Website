          The idea that UI and UX on a website are an indicator of manipulation
          tactics in this technology era has been argued among people for years
          as there have been arguments as to how the UI and UX of a website have
          been constructed to be unethical towards a user on the website. It has
          been stated the UI and UX of websites are unethical in their
          construction to manipulate the user to stay on the website to create
          traffic while exploiting the users’ behaviours. By investigating the
          system of News24’s website and the work of Marc Hassenzahl and Noam
          Tractinsky in “User experience - a research agenda” and studying “The
          Ethics of User Experience Design” by Peter Vistisen and Thessa Jensen.
          This essay will attempt to justify whether the construction of the
          website News24 is ethical through its UI and UX.
        </p>
        <p class="essayText">
          The term ethics/ethical refers to the principles and values of a
          person or group that one can use in determining whether an action is
          right, wrong, or even morally justified. (Dictionary.com 2023) From
          this understanding, it can be understood that ethics is about making
          informed decisions based on a person’s judgement to be better and more
          responsible. Therefore, through the understanding of ethics, we can
          determine whether News24 has made ethical design choices for the user.

          News24 is a media company in South Africa that provides information on
          news, analysis, business, sports, entertainment and many more. News24
          focus on local and international news that is accurate and timely
          information to its users. News24 provides its information through a
          website and mobile app, which allows for easy accessibility and use to
          the user. News24 displays video and audio content which allows for
          interactive tools and multimedia presentations.

          The role of the user interface is to provide ways in which the user
          can interact with the website to improve a user’s experience.
          (Interaction design foundation 2023.) Looking at News24’s website
          there are key UI features that stand out. First is the Homepage, which
          uses a white background to contrast with the larger images and bolder
          headline, making it easier for the user to visually read and go
          through to find what they are looking for or what interest them. It
          uses a grid layout to keep all the different types of articles in a
          consistent layout and keeps everything aligned for the user. Second is
          the navigation bar, it is placed close to the top of the page,
          allowing the user to browse through the category to find the section
          they are interested in making it to easily navigate the website as the
          users can also search for specific topics using the search bar.
          Further into the UI of the website is seen on the article pages. The
          article page is when the user clicks on an article to read further.
          The design is made so that it is easy to read, with clear typography
          and plenty of white space and using images and videos to break up the
          text. This allows the user to stay focused on the article during the
          short and consistent sentences. Another UI is the interactive features
          on the website. As it uses polls, quizzes, and live blogs, which are
          designed to encourage user engagement so they can feel as if they are
          part taking in providing the news while allowing for an immersive
          experience. The last key UI feature is News24 optimization for all
          devices The UI is responsive in design as it adjusts to the size of
          the screen. This ensures that users can easily access the website on
          any device. These are the key UI feature that allows for a better user
          experience on the website. This concept is iterated by Interaction
          Design Foundation when they explain the concept of “Good UI”
          (Interaction design foundation 2023)by explaining how UI must be kept
          simple and aligned for the user to that it is easy and simple to use
          while allowing the user to stay focused on the task they have. Thus,
          showing how News24 uses UI successfully for easy and simple user
          interaction and understanding.

          The design of UX and UI can have ethical implications. The ethical
          implication of UX and UI can vary from many options. There is an
          ethical concern about privacy. The UI and UX of News24 in
          personalization use techniques to create the user experience to
          individuals' interests and preferences. Data about the user's location
          or browsing history is gathered to recommend relevant news stories.
          This concept of data used by News24 is evaluated in "The Ethics of
          User Experience Design" where they about how “designers have a
          responsibility to protect user privacy” (Vistisen & Jensen 2021) as
          they talk about how the designers must be transparent with the user
          about the data collected, how it is used, and that the user should be
          able to choose whether to share that data with them or not. In News24,
          they follow this ethical concern of privacy by giving the user the
          option to share their information and in doing so allows them to be
          transparent about the data that is collected from their users, such as
          browsing history or location data, and how it is used. They also give
          users control over their data and opt out of data collection by
          changing those settings. This is protecting user privacy and building
          trust with their use to maintain a positive reputation. This is
          especially important given recent concerns about data breaches and
          misuse of personal information for News websites and applications.

          Along with privacy are the “dangers of distraction” (Geyser 2021) as
          an ethical concern. The danger of distraction refers to how the
          information provided can take focus away from the user from what they
          were doing. Depending on the type of medium the user is on will apply
          different types of distraction. In regards to the website, the
          designers of News24 take into consideration for dangers of distraction
          as this is indicated in their video news as the video does not
          automatically play but rather gives the user an option in which they
          can choose whether to play the video or not. This concept is referred
          to in “The Ethics of User Experience Design" when they state that it
          is “important to design products that respect users' time and
          attention.” (Vistisen & Jensen 2021) which means that the designer
          must always consider what the user will want to do as if they are busy
          and they must respect the user and allow they to choose when they want
          to view the information. For example, if push notifications are
          automatically done it may be more likely to distract users from their
          other important tasks. News24 allows the user to choose when to play a
          video or decide whether they get notifications for a piece of certain
          news, thus showing that News24's UI and UX were designed in an ethical
          manner that can avoid distraction from important tasks.

          Therefore, after a careful analysis of the research discussed through
          the website News24, we have found that the UI and UX of websites use
          manipulation tactics to draw the user into the website, but the fact
          that all the information is provided and that the users have control
          over their experience on the website leaves very little to no ethical
          concern.
