            A portfolio is generally a collection of work samples, projects, or
            achievements that showcases an individual's skills, abilities, and
            progression over time. It serves as a tangible representation of
            one's growth and development in a particular field. <br /><br />
            In my portfolio, I want to demonstrate the evolution and improvement
            of skills, knowledge, and creative thinking through a series of
            websites. This is why I decided to only use my website from this
            course which I have created as it will allow me and others to see my
            progress with web development. <br /><br />
            As my portfolio will effectively communicate the progression and
            continuous learning of my journey in interactive, providing valuable
            insights into my development and potential.
