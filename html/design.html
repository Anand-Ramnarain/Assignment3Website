          <h4 class="bSubhead">Goal</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            The goal of the website is to inspire the user by curating a
            visually captivating and immersive online experience that seamlessly
            navigation and blends in design, using minimalism, and modern
            functionality.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="bSubhead">Colour</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            On my website, I use 4 main types of colours. The first two are
            shades of grey and these are mainly used for the backgrounds. They
            used the grey-shaded backgrounds as it allowed for more of a visual
            contrast. As the grey backgrounds provide a neutral base that allows
            other website elements, such as the text, images, and buttons, to
            stand out more prominently. The contrast between the shades of grey
            and the content will enhance readability and make the website more
            visually appealing. The reason why I used two different shades of
            grey also is to create a form of separation in the section of the
            website. The use of grey backgrounds allows the user to focus on the
            content of the website. By using the subtle grey background, it
            focuses the users' attention towards the main content of the
            website. It prevents distractions and ensures that the focus remains
            on the information and visuals that I want to show. Using grey
            backgrounds also provided a sense of professionalism and elegance in
            appearance. The greys often create an elegant aesthetic, lending a
            professional touch to your website. It helps convey a sense of
            professionalism, reliability, and seriousness. Using grey background
            allows for versatility and accessibility. This means that the
            backgrounds can easily blend with different colour schemes and
            design elements <br /><br />Along with the grey backgrounds I used
            cyan and white for the other element in the website and I did this
            for: <br />
            Readability: White text on a grey background provides a high
            contrast, making the text easier to read. The use of cyan accents
            can enhance the visibility and importance of elements on the
            website. This colour scheme created a modern and clean aesthetic for
            the website. The combination of shades of grey and cyan with white
            elements creates a sleek and contemporary look for a website. This
            is because the colour scheme is associated with a minimalist design
            approach, which further conveys a sense of professionalism. The use
            of these colours creates a calm atmosphere on the website. This
            colour scheme is often used in websites related to wellness,
            technology, or other industries where a sense of peace is desired.
            <br /><br />The use of the colour scheme also represents me as a
            person in a way. As grey is often associated with neutrality and
            practicality. I feel this represent me in an aspect as in most
            situation I try to either avoid conflict and I always try to think
            about each aspect of a situation to find the best outcome.
            <br /><br />
            Cyan represents me in a way as it is a colour that often represents
            freshness and innovation. I feel as if this captures a part of me as
            certain things like food tasting, I always want to try and
            experience new things.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="bSubhead">Layout</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            The layout of the homepage has been changed as each section on this
            page displays a sample or part of what is on that page. If the user
            wants to view more, they can click on the button there so they can
            read more if they want to. In addition to this, the navbar for the
            homepage will rather remain at the top but it will rather take the
            user to that section on the homepage and not the page itself. I did
            it this way because as I was viewing a different type of website
            while looking for inspiration for mine, I saw that a large amount of
            portfolio website does this and made sense why to me. After all, in
            today's society, everyone wants a quick and effective way to view
            items as we have short attention spans. The reason why this works is
            that it allows the user it first see what they are going to view
            from the homepage and then the user will be able to decide whether
            they want to view that based on the small aspects that have been
            presented to them from the homepage. <br />
            <br />
            All the other pages' layout is similar as they will have the navbar
            at the top of the page to navigate to the other pages. This is like
            this to allow for easier navigation to the other pages. There will
            be a second navbar on the page under the first one if it is
            necessary just to take the user to the next section within that
            page. This is so that the user doesn’t have to scroll continuously
            till they find the section they want to. Under the second nav bar,
            the content of the page will be there. The navbar will always remain
            on the page so that the user to easier to move to different parts of
            the website. <br /><br />Each page of the website will have a footer
            which will contain a back-to-top part to allow the user to not again
            have to scroll back to the top of the page once they are done
            reading or when they have reached the bottom of the page. The layout
            for the blog's main page. Will be separated into 2 sections “block
            1” and “block 2”. In this section the user will be able to see all
            the blogs done in each block as well as a small part of what that
            blog is about once the user clicks on the blog, they will be taken
            to the a-week blog page. On this page will be the content but above
            the secondary navbar will have each week in it and this will be
            linked to each weekly blog so from the blogs they will not have to
            go back but rather have the option to go straight to it.
            <br /><br />The layout of a website refers to the arrangement and
            organization of its various elements and content on the web pages. A
            well-designed website layout ensures a logical and visually
            appealing structure that facilitates user navigation and engagement.
            While website layouts can vary based on design preferences and
            specific requirements, Here is the base layout for my design:
            <br /><br />
            Header: Located at the top of the page and will always be available
            to the user, the header will contain the website's logo, navigation
            menu <br />
            Navigation menu: This is a list of clickable links or buttons that
            allow users to navigate through different sections and pages of the
            website. It will be in the header. <br />
            Content area: This is the main section of the website where the
            primary content is displayed. This content area is often divided
            into various sections seen through the grey backgrounds to organize
            the information of my content. <br />Footer: Positioned at the
            bottom of the page, the footer contains additional navigation links
            to my websites and GitHub. <br />
            Responsive design: With the increasing use of mobile devices, my
            website is designed to be responsive, meaning I have adapted the
            display to properly be used on different screen sizes. This ensures
            a seamless user experience across various devices.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="bSubhead">Font</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            In my website, I would only like to use two types of fonts as I am
            being cautious I want to avoid creating a cluttered or disjointed
            look on my website by using multiple different types of fonts. It
            creates a consistency using only one type of font as then all my
            text and element in my website will blend in together and complement
            the overall appearance of the website also it creates an identity
            for the website through the consistency of only using 2 fonts.
            <br /><br />
            I want to use the Playfair Display font. As it will elevate elegance
            and professionalism in the website, through the high contrast
            between thick and thin strokes in the font, always for it to be
            readable and from its letterform and spacing. Using this type of
            font allows me to have a variety of options to choose the second
            type of font as I am unsure of the type of font I want to use.
            <br /><br />
            The second font I am considering using is Roboto. I mainly want to
            use this font because of its device compatibility. As roboto is
            optimized for screen display, which makes it best for websites. It
            renders on all devices and platforms. It also pairs nicely with
            Playfair Display because of its modern aesthetics. This font is
            modern and clean design and fits well with web elements. It has a
            neutral and approachable appearance, making it suitable for a wide
            range of use in the element of my website.

          <h4 class="bSubhead">Smooth Transitions</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            The smooth transition allows for improved user experience as Smooth
            transitions make the website feel more intuitive and seamless, which
            improves the user experience. When pages transition smoothly, it is
            easier for users to navigate and explore the site. Thus, allowing
            engagement from the Smooth transitions increases user engagement by
            keeping visitors on the site longer. When pages transition smoothly,
            it can encourage the user to explore more content and stay engaged
            with the site. To give a Visual appeal, smooth transitions are
            visually appealing and make a website feel more dynamic and
            interesting. When the pages transition smoothly, it creates a sense
            of movement and animation that adds visual interest to the site.
            Overall, using smooth transitions will improve the user experience,
            increase engagement, and add visual interest.

          <h4 class="bSubhead">Keeping The Pages Simple</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            Keeping the pages simple and clear gets clarity and simplicity: By
            giving the user several interactive elements on a website, the user
            interface can be made clearer and easier to navigate as the user
            will then have an option of where they want to go on the website.
            This will help users to focus on the content and information they
            are looking for, rather than getting distracted by unnecessary or
            confusing interface elements.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="bSubhead">Other Style Notes</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            Another aspect I want to include is the wireframes. Here is want to
            compress images or find a way in which they are small and I want to
            put them I like a slideshow format and then theuser has the option
            to go through it to see the design of the wireframes and hopefully
            in this way it can allow the webpage to also load more quickly,
            which can be a significant advantage for users who may not have
            high-speed internet connections or who are accessing the site on
            mobile devices. Thus, making it Mobile-friendly, keeping the website
            with a minimal interactive interface makes the website more
            mobile-friendly, as it was easier to design a responsive layout that
            works well on smaller screens and large screens when there are fewer
            interactive elements to consider.

          <p class="essayText">
            The design of my assignment 1 website has changed significantly in
            my assignment 3 website. This is mainly through planning, time
            management and an increase in my skill level in coding. Here we like
            to look into the different aspects in which I changed and further
            progressed my website to show how I am slowly progressing in my
            skill level. These are just some of the aspects as others will be
            talked about in other parts of my design section.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="bSubhead">The Homepage</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            As you can see, I redesign my homepage to encapsulate what my
            website is all about. In assignment 1 my website was a complete mess
            in its design and style, as sections didn’t completely fit the
            screen, my footer was too long with space, and the scaling and
            placement never fit all too well. Investigating it further the
            website homepage says a lot about the creator and the website
            itself. Yes, it is simple and easy to navigate but from what I can
            see, it says a lot about me in how unorganized it is. Even the
            section “About” and “What I want to achieve” on the page is untidy
            and it doesn’t give the user much information on what the website is
            about. This is also why I changed the design of the homepage to a
            clear and modern look. I changed the homepage to rather give a
            sample of what each section is about or what is in that section.
            This is so that the user can first see what is on the page/section
            before heading to it. In modern-day people would rather read a small
            aspect of information to decide whether or not they want to read
            more and the new design allows for this. Here the navbar in my
            homepage work solely for the homepage as it directs the user to the
            section on the home page instead of taking them to the other page.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="bSubhead">Blog Section</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            The main change in the blog section is that I have added a blog main
            page, so the user will be able to view the number of blogs done as
            in the assignment 1 website, when the user clicks on the blog
            section it would automatically take them straight to the week 1
            blog. This way allows the user to see the different types of blogs
            and choose which week they would like to view. Doing this also
            allowed for another form of interaction on my website as the viewer
            has more of an option in what they can choose to view. I have kept
            the secondary navbar for when the user is in a blog so that it
            provides them easy access to which to another blog instead of going
            back to the main blog page.

            Here I have decided to make my portfolio and profile section two
            different pages. As it allows for clarity and focuses as separating
            the profile and portfolio helps the user clearly understand the
            purpose and content of the section. A profile typically contains
            information about me. On the other hand, a portfolio showcases my
            actual work and projects. This clear division allows users to
            quickly find what they are looking for without confusion. Since I
            want to try and include a search bar in the future, this separation
            will allow the optimization of the search.

          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            This section is a complete mess and I am try trying to figure it all
            out and how I want it to look. The main issues in my assignment 1
            design section are that the page is too long, the text falls off the
            page and the word gap is too far apart in some spaces. This was
            because of the design of horizontal scrolling but it didn’t work out
            and I want to keep the horizontal. Scroll effect but I may just put
            it all vertically on the page, even though the page may be longer
            the positioning and scaling will remain intact.

            UI (User Interface) refers to the visual elements, controls, and
            layout of a digital product or website that users interact with. It
            encompasses everything that users see and interact with on a screen,
            including buttons, menus, forms, icons, and any other visual
            components. UI design focuses on creating a visually appealing and
            intuitive interface that enhances user experience. <br /><br />
            User Experience (UX) refers to the overall experience that users
            have when interacting with the website. It encompasses every aspect
            of the user's interaction, including their perceptions, emotions,
            and behaviours. UX design aims to create intuitive, meaningful, and
            enjoyable experiences for the user. Ultimately, UX focuses on
            delivering a seamless and delightful experience that meets user
            expectations and drives user engagement.

          <h4 class="bSubhead">Navigation Menu</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            My website has a clean, modern and well-organized navigation menu at
            the top of the page, which has links such as "Home," and "Profile."
            "Portfolio," "blogs," “and design” The UI of the navbar includes
            visually appealing typography, and interactive hover effects to
            provide feedback to users. This is so that the user can know which
            page they are on and this will allow the user to navigate seamlessly
            through the website as when the user clicks on the link it will take
            them to that part of the website.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="bSubhead">Secondary Nav</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            the secondary nav is only I certain pages where by the sections have
            been broken up and each contains a header. So this is if the user
            wants to view a certain aspect on that page they will be able to
            just click in and it will take them to that section of the page.
            This is because certain vary in length and it would be tedious and
            frustrating for the user to have to scroll down just for them to
            find the section they are looking for.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="bSubhead">Profile</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            The profile on my website is just a small understanding of who I am
            and what I want to achieve in this website and course. There isn’t
            much into the interaction aspect of this here as I wanted to keep it
            simple in the sense of representing who I am and I want the user to
            focus more on my content than interaction on the website.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="bSubhead">Blogs</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            The homepage and main blog section are containers of each weekly
            blog and in these, there is a small introduction to the blog. I
            design it this way to allow the user to see what they may be reading
            about in that week's blog before they decide to go and read more
            about it. This is so that the user has the option of which weekly
            blog post they would like to view making it more of a pleasant
            experience on the website so that they aren’t just taken straight to
            a blog post and have to read all of it to find what they want to
            know.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="bSubhead">Blog Secondary nav</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            If the user is in a weekly blog post, I have made the secondary
            navbar in the blogs to show all the weeks, this is to allow the user
            to move from one blog to another but in a way, they can choose which
            weekly blog post they want to go to. This is so the user has the
            option of going from week 1 to week 5 without having to go back out
            of the main blog page or without having to go through each blog post
            to find which one they want to view. <br /><br />
            Also if the user wants to go in order, I have put an arrow icon at
            the bottom of each blog post which will take the user to the next or
            previous blog post this is so that once they reach the end of the
            post and they want to just go the next one just can click it instead
            of going to the secondary nav to find the next week blog post this
            way then can just move seamlessly to the next or previous one.
            <br /><br />
            In certain sections like my blogs and essay, I have put a different
            grey back just to separate the text aspect and the background of the
            website. This is so that the text is kept within a container and so
            it can focus the user's attention on that aspect of the website as
            the user's attention goes from the header to which part they must
            focus on next. This was a great way to divide certain sections in
            the website so that everything is not just placed and crammed onto
            the website.

          <h4 class="bSubhead">Portfolio Grid</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            This showcases my design projects, I use a grid layout on the
            "Portfolio" section and page. So each portfolio item would consist
            of thumbnail images, along with titles or captions of that project.
            The UI of the grid would ensure consistent spacing, visually
            pleasing image proportions, and hover effects that indicate
            interactivity. This is so the viewer can have a general idea of the
            project before going into it and it allows for the user to see the
            basic part of each of my projects without having to go and visit the
            site
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="bSubhead">Footer</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            The footer of the website contain the links to both of my
            assignments Github and the website then the user to seamlessly move
            to the sites and they then can go and view the code of the website
            if they would like to. I have also in my footer includes an up arrow
            which will take the user to the top of the page. This is so the user
            doesn’t have to scroll back up once they have reached the end of the
            page.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="bSubhead">Overall</h4>
          <br />
          <p class="essayText">
            Overall, UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) play crucial
            roles in enhancing the overall user satisfaction and effectiveness
            of a digital product or service. A well-designed UI focuses on
            creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface, where
            elements are organized, consistent, and easily understandable. I
            feel as if I have achieved this as my website facilitates seamless
            navigation and interaction, allowing users to view and interact with
            my website efficiently. On the other hand, UX involves the holistic
            experience a user has while engaging with a website, I feel like I
            have included factors like usability, accessibility, and emotional
            engagement to ensure good UX in my website, to allow for
            functionality, and encounter minimal frustrations. By providing
            clear information, and minimizing cognitive load, My website's UI
            and UX contribute to a positive user experiences.
