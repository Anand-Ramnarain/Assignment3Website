          <p>
            This was my first-time using GitHub and setting it up. I didn’t
            understand how it works but after going through the tutorial and
            YouTube videos, I think I understand how to use GitHub to save my
            progress and have it there if anything were to go wrong, as it is
            also a way to share and view code with multiple people. It seems
            like more of an effective way to send in code for an assignment than
            the files which sometimes don’t even open...

          <p>
            When starting to learn about HTML I was excited as I love coding and
            learning how to use different languages as it is my first-time
            coding with HTML. With any new language is it kind of easy to start
            to learn as almost all coding languages are very similar therefore
            it was simple enough to get the hang of it quickly as I start
            learning coding from Delphi in high school which is a harder
            language to learn first...

            It is very exciting to learn CSS and to see how goes in hand with
            HTML to create and design a visually aesthetic website. The lectures
            helped me engage with the content in a way that allow me to code
            alongside to effectively understand the work without losing track of
            what is happening.The lecture showed me how there are different
            methods in how to code with CSS and HTML,which helps in
            understanding different aspects of the code...

          <h3 class="essayHeader">Ethics Of UI and UX on News24</h3>
          <p class="essayHomeText">
            The idea that UI and UX on a website are an indicator of
            manipulation tactics in this technology era has been argued among
            people for years as there have been arguments as to how the UI and
            UX of a website have been constructed to be unethical towards a user
            on the website. It has been stated the UI and UX of websites are
            unethical in their construction to manipulate the user to stay on
            the website to create traffic while exploiting the users'
            behaviours. By investigating the system of News24's website and the
            work of Marc Hassenzahl and Noam Tractinsky in “User experience - a
            research agenda” and studying “The Ethics of User Experience Design”
            by Peter Vistisen and Thessa Jensen. This essay will attempt to
            justify whether the construction of the website News24 is ethical
            through its UI and UX.
          </p>
          <p class="essayHomeText">
            The term ethics/ethical refers to the principles and values of a
            person or group that one can use in determining whether an action is
            right, wrong, or even morally justified. (Dictionary.com 2023) From
            this understanding, it can be understood that ethics is about making
            informed decisions based on a person’s judgement to be better and
            more responsible. Therefore, through the understanding of ethics, we
            can determine whether News24 has made ethical design choices for the
            user.

            News24 is a media company in South Africa that provides information
            on news, analysis, business, sports, entertainment and many more.
            News24 focus on local and international news that is accurate and
            timely information to its users. News24 provides its information
            through a website and mobile app, which allows for easy
            accessibility and use to the user. News24 displays video and audio

          <h3 class="essayHeader">Mitigating the Risk of Extinction from AI</h3>
          <p class="essayHomeText">
            The idea that AI and Algorithmic Culture is an indication of the
            pervasive influence of algorithms and AI in various aspects of our
            daily lives, shapes our behaviours, preferences, and experiences. It
            has been said that “Mitigating the risk of extinction from Al should
            be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as
            pandemics and nuclear war.” (Center for Al Safety 2023) By
            investigating systems of digital inequalities, the internet,
            society, design justice, and ethical internet; this essay will
            attempt to justify whether reducing the risks from AI and
            Algorithmic Culture should be a global priority.
          </p>
          <p class="essayHomeText">
            To understand this statement, “Mitigating the risk of extinction
            from Al should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale
            risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” (Center for Al Safety
            2023) Let’s break it down to know the extent of its meaning. The
            first part is “Mitigating the risk of extinction” This is focusing
            on minimizing or preventing the possibility of a case in which
            humanity could cease to exist. This statement refers to the
            potential threat of artificial intelligence, which could have
            catastrophic consequences if not controlled.
          </p>
          <p class="essayHomeText">
            The next aspect in the statement is that it should be a “Global
            priority” implying that the risk of extinction from Al should be
            treated as a matter of importance at a global level. Suggesting that
            governments, and organizations around the world should pay
            attention, resources, and efforts to address this before it can
            become an issue. The next part is “Societal-scale risks” as it
            compares the risk of extinction from Al to other significant risks
            that impact can societies...
